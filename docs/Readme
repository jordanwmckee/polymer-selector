This is where you'd put non-sensitive client documents. If you have documents
that you'd rather the client never saw, then you should have a completely
separate folder somewhere well outside of this client's folder.

building dockerfile:

docker buildx build --load -t jordanwmckee/polymer-selector -f docs/Dockerfile .

OpenCon() change:

function OpenCon() {
   $dbhost = "db";
   $dbuser = "root";
   $dbpass = "pass";
   $db = "polymer_selectordb";

   $conn = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass,$db) or die("Connect failed: %s\n". $conn -> error);
   
   return $conn;
}
